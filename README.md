A timed typing game that has a Monty Hall bet to win Monopoly (fictional) money!

SUMMARY: During my stint at a startup called Captricity, every quarter we are given 1 week called Challenge Week where we can build anything we want. Capsino is the 2nd game I built. One of the lead engineers jokingly brought up a hypothetical game called Capsino where Captricity would reward workers with a casino-type game. He mentioned it; I built it! The clock stops and you type as fast and accurately as you can. Upon submitting your answer, the computer checks certain words for accuracy. If you successfully clear the level, then you win the opportunity to play a pseudo-Monty Hall game. You get to pick 1 of 4 doors, and pray to the Probabilistic Gods that you win. Rinse and repeat--endless fun.

HOW TO PLAY: Just fork and clone the repo and run the entire code. Then, type "play.capsino()" and then you can play the game. Type as fast and accurately as you can; you have a time limit and an accuracy threshold.

You are fighting against the clock!  
Do NOT stop typing until you see your progress report.  
There are Gold Standards.  
And don't forget, you are being WATCHED...not by a watchman...but by the ever-present CLOCK.  
May the Turker Force be with you!

Riddle me this: Behind this wall are 4 doors  
They can either make you rich or make your poor  
There is but 1 prize  
but here's a surprise  
The winning door pays out its name  
But don't get greedy, that's the game  
After you pick, 2 doors disappear  
For you, it might bring joy or fear  
As nobody knows what's behind the door, not even me!  
So may I ask, what door for thee? 1/2/3/4
