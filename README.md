A timed typing game that has a Monty Hall bet to win Monopoly (fictional) money!

SUMMARY: During my stint at a startup called Captricity, every quarter we are given 1 week called Challenge Week where we can build anything we want. Capsino is the 2nd game I built. One of the lead engineers jokingly brought up a hypothetical game called Capsino where Captricity would reward workers with a casino-type game. He mentioned it; I built it! The clock stops and you type as fast and accurately as you can. Upon submitting your answer, the computer checks certain words for accuracy. If you successfully clear the level, then you win the opportunity to play a pseudo-Monty Hall game. You get to pick 1 of 4 doors, and pray to the Probabilistic Gods that you win. Rinse and repeat--endless fun.

HOW TO RUN IT: Just fork and clone the repo and run the entire code. Then, type "play.capsino()" and then you can play the game. Type as fast and accurately as you can; you have a time limit and an accuracy threshold.
